Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A. The .git sub directory gets created. This allows goit to recognise the current directory a git repository.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A. You add files to the staging area before you make a commit. It allows you to commit changes to a subset of the files you have actually changed in the working area.

Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A. Just add the files related to the logical change to the staging area before perfoming the commit.
