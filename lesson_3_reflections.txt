Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. A remote repository would be used when you're looking to share the project with others, work on it from different computers or simply as a backup.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. If someone else is making changes you might like to review them before updating your local repository with these changes.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A. Forks only exist on GitHub and are a copy of another repository. Once forked the repository is independent of the original. This would be used to create a copy that you can then update independently. A clone is a copy of a github repository or a local repository. A clone stays linked to the original repository and updates can be pulled and pushed between them. A branch exists within a single repository and can be used to, for example, make some experimental changes to code without changing you existing master branch.

Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A. On the local copy it is possible to tell if the commits are ahead of the remote copy since the last pull. Also fetching the remote copy as another local branch allows merges to be performed locally.

Q. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A. You could use a shared directory on a site like Dropbox and then use emails or IM to discuss changes being made. It would be difficult to merge changes made by different people.
